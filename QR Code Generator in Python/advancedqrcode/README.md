## QR Code Generation in Python.
In this video we learn how to generate QR Code using Python. We also change its color, boarder size etc.
First of all we install the Python library. pip install qrcode[pil]. pil for qrcode image formating. We import qrcode, We write qr variable, and equal to to it qrcode, then write dot after dot we write QRCode. 
QRCode is a function in PIL which change the functionality of qrcode like version, change error because when we made general qrcode here is the possibility of error, possibility of overlaping. We get ride from these things by the use of PIL, so in brackets I write version, in qrcode many version are presnts and I write first version, then I used error correction to remove error, there are many types of errors in qrcode, so I suggest you to remove high level error, then box_size and finally border. In the variable qr we apply dot then add undercose data in brackets we paste the link or text that we wanna generate qrcode, Now we make the qrcode, in the bracket of make function we write fit equal to true, because the data come from url we place the true value of it, then it generate the qrcode otherwise not. Now we change the coloe of qrcode, we made variable asif, asif equal to qr dot make underscore image function, in the bracket of function we define color. and finally save, in save function we write the name of qrcode the qrcode in image in the png format.
